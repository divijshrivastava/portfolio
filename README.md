   <h1>Divij's Portfolio Website</h1>
   <p>Welcome to the repository of my portfolio website, <a href="https://www.divij.tech" target="_new">divij.tech</a>. This website serves as a platform for showcasing my projects, sharing blog posts, and providing information about my social media handles and contact details.</p>
   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>The portfolio website is built using Angular for the frontend and Java for the backend. It follows a monolithic architecture, where the frontend is compiled into static files, and the Java backend provides dynamic data to the frontend.</p>
   <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
   <ul>
      <li>Frontend: Angular 14</li>
      <li>Backend: Java 11</li>
      <li>Framework: Spring</li>
      <li>Persistence: JPA with Spring Data JPA</li>
      <li>Authentication and Authorization: Spring Security </li>
      <li>Database: MySQL</li>
      <li>Database Migration and Version Control: Liquibase</li>
   </ul>
   <p>I chose the Spring framework for the backend as it offers a wide range of functionality out of the box and provides easy integration with other frameworks, especially for security (using Spring Security).</p>
   <p>To handle data persistence, I utilize Spring Data JPA, which simplifies database interactions. Currently, I am using MySQL as the database for its ease of setup and extensive documentation and community support available on platforms like Stack Overflow.</p>

   <h2>Getting Started</h2>
   <p>To set up and run the portfolio website locally, follow these steps:</p>
   <ol>
      <li>
         <p>Clone this repository to your local machine:</p>
         <pre><div class="bg-black rounded-md mb-4"><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-shell">git clone https://github.com/divijshrivastava/portfolio.git
</code></div></div></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>Install the necessary dependencies for the frontend. Navigate to the frontend directory and run:</p>
         <pre><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto">
         <code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-nnnn">
         cd portfolio
         npm install
         </code>
         </div></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>Configure the backend. Set up your MySQL database and update the database configuration in the backend code.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>Build the frontend. In the frontend directory, run:</p>
         <pre><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-shell">ng build
</code></div></pre>
         <p>This will generate the compiled static files that will be served by the backend.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>Run the backend. In the root directory, start the backend server using your preferred Java IDE or build tool.</p>
